Ransomware Project
==================

This project is a proof-of-concept ransomware program developed for educational purposes only. It should NOT be used for any malicious or illegal activities. The program was developed as part of a school project to demonstrate the techniques used by ransomware programs to encrypt files on a victim's computer and demand a ransom in exchange for the decryption key.

Program Overview
----------------

The program consists of two main files:

-   `encrypt.py`: This script is responsible for encrypting all the files within a specified folder on the victim's computer using the AES encryption algorithm. Once the files are encrypted, a ransom note is displayed on the victim's screen, demanding payment in exchange for the decryption key.
-   `decrypt.py`: This script is responsible for decrypting the encrypted files using the AES decryption algorithm. The program prompts the user for the decryption key, which should be provided upon payment of the ransom.

Additional files used by the program include:

-   `sendTelegramMessage.py`: This script sends a message to a specified Telegram chat containing the system information of the victim's computer and the encryption key used by the ransomware.
-   `music.wav`: This is a background music file that plays while the ransom note is displayed on the victim's screen.

Installation
------------

Before running the program, you must install the required Python modules. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

This will install all the required modules listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

Running the Program
-------------------

WARNING: Running this program on a computer without permission is illegal and could result in severe consequences.

To run the program:

1.  Clone or download the repository onto your local machine.
2.  Navigate to the repository directory.
3.  Modify the `folders_path` variable in `encrypt.py` to specify the folder(s) that you want to encrypt.
4.  Run `encrypt.py`. This will encrypt all the files in the specified folder(s) using a randomly generated encryption key.
5.  The program will display a ransom note on the victim's screen, demanding payment in exchange for the decryption key.
6.  Once payment is made, the victim can run `decrypt.py` to decrypt their files. The program will prompt the user for the decryption key provided upon payment.

Conclusion
----------

This project is a demonstration of the harmful effects of ransomware and serves as a reminder to use technology ethically and responsibly. It is important to always seek permission before performing any actions on another person's computer and to avoid engaging in any illegal activities.
